<h1><u> Branding </u> <h1/>
  
  <p>In developing the branding for <a href="http://www.fieldsnow.com" class="class1">FIELD SNOW</a> I saw a need for 
    clean, minimal and high quality ski and snowboard goggles. I chose to pursue this minimal aesthetic through strong
    lines in out logos and products, a predominantly black and white colour pallette and a strong social media presence.
    <br><br>
    I developed <a href="http://www.fieldsnow.com/in-the-field" class="class1">In The Field</a> as both a lookbook and 
    a way to improve my website's search engine optimisation. Using this colleciton of images supplied by FIELD's athletes 
    and customers I created a simple but powerful tool for our branding. <br><br>
    
    Whilst witnessing the climate related disasters during early 2020 in Australia, I decided that FIELD needed to pursue a 
    more environmentally friendly path. After discussions with the factory that FIELD works with, I decided that the risks 
    related to quality control when working with recycled plastics were too high. This is why I developed our tree planting 
    program <a href="http://www.choptstudio.com.au" class="class1">FIELD GOOD</a>. I commissioned art from 
    <a href=https://www.instagram.com/crashstal/" class="class1">Crystal</a> to help spice up the page and help build the 
    programs aesthetic. <br><br>
    
    I helped develop <a href=https://www.choptstudio.com.au" class="class1">Chopt Studio</a>'s branding through refining their 
    online persona, development of a colour palette and refining Chopt's aesthetic.
